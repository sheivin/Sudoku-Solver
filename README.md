Sudoku-Solver
=============

This is my attempt at making a basic Sudoku Solver using Backtracking Algorithm in Java

NOTE: The input should be passed in the command line in the form of an array of String, with the first character of each element denoting the row number, the second denoting the column number and the third denoting the number itself.
